# NutriTrack-AI

NutriTrack-AI is a AI-powered mobile app built with [Expo](https://expo.dev) and designed to help users track their macros. The app utilizes a [`AI backend`](https://github.com/A5TA/NutriTrack-AI-Backend) to handle CRUD operations and a [`AI Predictor`](https://github.com/A5TA/NutriTrack-AI-Predictor) to perform image classification for user uploaded meal images.

## Features

### Food Recognition & Tracking 
* AI-powered food recognition to accurately identify and analyze meals from pictures.
* Database of different food macronutrients (proteins, carbohydrates, and fats).
* Allows users to manually input macros of their food if not already stored.
* Allows users to take pictures of food with the built in camera or image upload.

### Health Insights & History
* Visualizes daily, weekly, and monthly nutrition data with daily list or calander.
* Tracks key health macros and showcases the userâ€™s progress toward their health goals.

### Other
* Simple Authentication via username to see personally tracked meals
* User Session handling to remember logged in user and set settings 

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
